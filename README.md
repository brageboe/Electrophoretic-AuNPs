# Electrophoretic-AuNPs
Calculates electromagnetic radiofrequency absorption and heat rates of ellipsoidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) undergoing electrophoretic oscillation, using electrostatic Mie scattering theory.

The code is the basis for the research results presented in the paper: B. B. Svendsen and M. Dalarsson, "Electrophoretic Absorption of Ellipsoidal Gold Nanoparticlesâ€”A Parameter Study," in IEEE Journal of Electromagnetics, RF and Microwaves in Medicine and Biology, doi: 10.1109/JERM.2024.3509216.

The file 'example_spheroidalGNPs_DL.m' show typical usage in how to plot the 3D colorplots. Uncomment/comment lines of the figure you wish to plot.
